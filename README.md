# TACS

/*This is TACS, or Todd's Awesome Combat System. Please note that I did not write this code, nor do I even understand most of it.
It's just here for those who want to attempt to adapt it for their own purposes. It was created many years ago for the now-defunct 
Transformers 2005 MUSH and was designed to function in PennMUSH only. It is currently in use on Transformers: The Dark Eras MUSH (TDE),
a similar Transformers-themed game that opened in 2015 and also runs PennMUSH. Unfortunately, the individual who created the code originally
is no longer a part of the MUSH community and is not available for contact.*/
